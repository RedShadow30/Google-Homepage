# Google.com Clone

### This project utilizes HTML and CSS to create the famous Google.com homepage. 
#### Basics
<p>
    HTML : hypertext markup language. Skeleton of the website. It is the information that the website holds (text, buttons, search box). <br>
    CSS : cascading style sheets. Layer that adds color, size, and shape to the skeleton.

#### About this project
This is a beginner project for me to understand the basic components of building a static web page. Next, I would like to learn how to add animations and more dynamic content to a web page.

#### To be able to see the web page from your local device:
1. Click on the "<> Code" button on GitHub
2. Under Local > HTTPS > copy the HTTPS address
3. Navigate to VS Code
4. Select the "Clone Git repository..." option
5. Paste the copied HTTPS address and hit Enter
    This should prompt you to select a Folder destination to clone the repository into.
    After selecting a destination, select "Trust Authors" and you should see the files to create the web page.
6. Install the "Live Server" extension on VS Code
7. On the bottom right side of your VS Code screen, click on the "Go Live" option. (next to "Markdown" and Bell icon)
8. The static web page should now appear through a web browser!
