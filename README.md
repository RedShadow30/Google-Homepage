### Google.com Clone

This project utilizes HTML and CSS to create the famous Google.com homepage. HTML is hypertext markup language and can be best thought of as the skeleton of the website. It is the information that the website holds (text, buttons, search box). CSS is cascading style sheets and this is the layer that adds color, size, and shape to the skeleton.

This is a beginner project that is to understand the basic components to building a static web page. Next, I would like to learn how to add animations and more dynamic content to a web page.

To be able to see the web page from your local device:
1. Click on the "<> Code" button on GitHub
2. Under Local > HTTPS > copy the HTTPS address
3. Navigate to VS Code
4. Select the "Clone Git repository..." option
5. Paste the copied HTTPS address and hit Enter
    This should prompt you to select a Folder destination to clone the repository into.
    After selecting a destination, select "Trust Authors" and you should see the files to create the web page.
6. Install the "Live Server" extension on VS Code
7. On the bottom right side of your VS Code screen, click on the "Go Live" option. (next to "Markdown" and Bell icon)
8. The static web page should now appear through a web browser!
